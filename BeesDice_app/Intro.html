<p>In this experiment, you will be reporting your financial and accounting income.<br>
You will roll digital dice to determine the value of the incomes.<br>
You need to report the total amount of your dice rolls.<br>
The rolls are in a random order, but can be traced back to you using an audit/SEC check. <br>
After rolling for your financial income, students selected to be part of the SEC have the option of verifying your income. <br>
They have limited ability to check and most will not be. <br>
Your accounting income will be a separate roll because of things like deferred taxes <br>
When you report your accounting income, there is a 10% chance of getting audited.<br>
If your financial income is not the same as the dice rolls during an SEC check, it may trigger an audit (10% chance) <br>
If your accounting income is not the same as the dice rolls during an audit, the SEC will be informed and can choose to check</p>
